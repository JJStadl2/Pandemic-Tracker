# Virus Spread Simulation

This Python program simulates the spread of a virus within a population under various conditions, including immunity factors and vaccine effectiveness. The program generates detailed graphs to track the impact of each scenario, offering insights into epidemic dynamics.

### Key Features:
- **Simulation**: Models virus transmission within a population, accounting for immunity levels and vaccine effectiveness.
- **Visualization**: Produces comprehensive graphs to illustrate the effects of different scenarios, helping to understand the dynamics of an epidemic.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Allows users to modify parameters such as infection rate, immunity levels, and vaccine efficacy to observe different outcomes.

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Virus-Spread-Simulation.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed.
3. **Run the simulation**: Execute `python simulate.py` to start exploring various epidemic scenarios.

### Future Enhancements:
- Addition of more complex models that include factors like mutation rates and social behaviors.
- Incorporation of real-world data for more accurate and realistic simulations.
- Development of an interactive interface for easier manipulation of simulation parameters.
